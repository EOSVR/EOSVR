[中文版](evr-cn.md)

EVR Token is a basic token for EOSVR ecosystem. Represent user's contribution to EOSVR. 

EOSVR will issue 10,000,000,000 EVR. 

- 3,000,000,000 will be locked in 2-5 years for EOSVR team. 

- 1,000,000,000 will be used to airdrop of EOS mainnet with 1:1.

- 6,000,000,000 will be used to support the build of EOSVR and its ecosystem.


### Other tokens in EOSVR

EOSVR worlds have a [complain](README.md#Audit) system. So in most world, users can lock other users' token. EVR will not be locked. And it can change to other region's token.

Before a user enter other world, he may change some of his EVR to another token.

  
### Airdrop Plan

Airdrop will open after 2018/06/25. EOSVR will send EVR to the registered user every several days (in most cases, will be 2 times per week).

Airdrop method:

- All genesis account can send 0.0001 EOS to eosvrairdrop to register. Will return EVR by the amount of EOS when mainnet started. Airdrop is only available for the account which amount of EOS >= 50.

- Other account can not register in this way, but the first 100K EOS send to eosvrairdrop will be returned 100 times EVR.
After 100K EOS sent, transfer to eosvrairdrop will fail, except 0.0001 EOS.
