## Trust Solution

This is a trust solution by providing a way to lock trust points of each other.

### Introduction

We need to meet different persons or shops everyday. We need to judge if they are trustable. Current ways to judge like the following:

- By clothing and behavior,
  But someone may dress up deliberately to cheat others;

- By endorsement from a friend;
  But friend may have wrong judgement.

- Shops use brand and/or physical stores to support their credit;
  But small shop is hard to survive when they do not have a brand, even if they have good products. And a physical store may relocate;

Once the judgement is wrong, the way to revenge like the following:

- Appeal to a third-party organization (e.g. court);
  But it will take a very long time and/or lots of money;

- Revenge directly (e.g. hit);
  In this way, both sides have loss and can not withdraw. And it is always hard to find the treater to revenge. In most scam with small amount of loss, the victim will give up the revenge because it takes too long time to find the cheater. And the cheater can cheat other persons again and again.
  
- Show the proof in network;
  But it is only useful when cheater is a famous brand. No one will notice a small brand in network. And victim always find they are hard to prove the error of cheater.

Current trust solution have many issues. In current block chain system, we hope to find a better solution.

### Solution

The solution is a block chain system. In this system every account is equal, and they have trust points. And:

- The trust points in an account is the trust of account;

- Account can use trust point to revenge another account by locking its trust point;

Example: 
  A have 1000 trust points. If A do evil to B, B think his loss equals 100 points. B can use 100 trust points to lock 100 trust points of A. After that, A have only 900 trust points. 
  
  If B and A discuss and resolve the conflict, B can unlock these 100 points. Both A and B will get back their 100 points in locking.

This solution can use in most of the small conflict in society. People can resolve their conflicts automatically and will make a better society.


### Scenarios

#### Peddlers

Peddlers sell their products without a fixed location. They need accounts to prove their products are good. A custom will lock trust points of peddlers when their products are bad, even if peddlers have left.

#### Services

Shops of services need accounts, because:

- When customs are receiving services, customs may be hard to express their discontent. Because after that, service staff may be unhappy to serve;

- Current complaint system is centralized. The complaint centers are always overwhelmed. And the complaint systems are opaque to customs. Customs are still discontent because they do not find any loss of shops.

- In lots of condition, custom can not prove their loss;

But if shops have accounts, customs can lock their trust points directly. And customs do not need to prove anything, because they also pay their points.


Lots of scenes have this kind of requirement. Such as: Restaurant, Taxi, Education & Training, etc.

In these scenarios, customs are hard to express their discontent. But if shops show their accounts and do evil, their trust points may be locked in the future.

#### Loss after a long period

In some condition, the loss can be found after several months, even several years. This account can protect this kind of loss. Because even after several months and the cheater can not be found, victims can still lock the trust points in the account.

This will help people to think the effect of long period, instead of short-term profits.

#### Articles

The trust account can make an article to be more trustable too.

Now there are lots of fake news in network. If there is a trust account endorsing the article, the article is trustable. Because if it is a fake news, the victims (the people who read the news) will lock the trust points of account.

After there are enough articles that have trust account, users can select to view articles that have trust account. And will not be disturbed by untrustable articles.

#### Other social issues

Crank call, spam or unsafe drive, etc, can also resolve if bind with trust account:

- Only receive the call and email from an account with positive trust point. If find the call or email is not good, lock its trust points;

- Only allow the car with trust account drive in the road; everyone who find the car drive unsafely, can lock its trust points;

Because these behaviour will impact lots of people, even if only a small portion of people will revenge, the cheaters will also lose lots of their trust points.


### Functions

To implement these, trust system should have the following features:

- Accounts can lock each other;
  This make the account is trustable.

- Restrict the amount of trust point to transport from an account to another;
  This make the account can not move all of their trust points to another account after they do evil;

- Allow delayed transfer and synchronous transfer;
  This make it possible to transfer across-chain and synchronous with real society.


### Conclusion

This trust system will make our society better.

### Q/A

Q: The account with lots of trust points may suppress normal persons and small shops.

A: Single person can not be suppressed because they can change to another account. Small shops may be suppressed. At these time, they can reveal the evidence by network. And other accounts with lots of trust points can intervene.


Q: What endorses the trust points? Why will we use it?

A: Nothing endorse it. It is only an experiment to find if there is a way to create a better trust system in block-chain.


Q: If you are kidnapped by cheaters, how to lock their accounts?

A: This is only to resolve the small conflicts. And it is only limited trustable. It is useless when you are unsafe. The safety should be protected by the army or police.


Q: In this system, people may tend to say good news and do not say bad news. Because bad news will make others unhappy. How to resolve it?

A: Hope this system can reward the people who provide true messages instead of good messages. So in the reward system, may add some rewards to the people who report bad news. Hope it can work. Also hope the people who have lots of trust point can support the people who say bad and real news.


Q: In an innovation, some people will get profit, but there must be another people will get loss. Because people always hate loss, the people who gain will only support you limited (Example: 20% earning), but the people who loss will be against you fully (Example: 100% reject). In this way, no one will innovate. How to resolve ?

A: Yes. The system is not suitable for an innovation condition. It is better for a common condition.


Q: People will not know this system at the first. Because it is very different with current environment. How to resolve?

A: Now this system is only used for:

  1, Create side-chains of EOS, and allow develops can use block-chain in traditional way;
  
  2, Endorse the transfer between side-chains;
  
  3, The trust of people in network;
  
  It will take a long time to extent it to real world. We must be familiar with it first. It is only a supplement that network (or real world) lack a way to revenge. It will not replace current system.
