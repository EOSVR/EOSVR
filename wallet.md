- Airdrop for [EVR](evr.md)


[IOS](https://test.gvrcraft.com/download.html) 

IOS is enterprise version. In Settings -> General -> Device Management, need to authorize the APP.

[Android](https://test.gvrcraft.com/eosvr.apk)

We use an account guest1111113 for test. Click "Import Guest3" , instead of "Import Private Key", to use it.

We may transfer a few EOS tokens to this account at times for testing. Use it to create your account freely.


### Safety

- EOSVR do NOT have any server except web servers in web. 

- This APP will NOT connect to any server except the EOS mainnet API site which you can change in settings. So it is impossible for EOSVR to stole custom's private key.

- You can change your password in APP if you are afraid that maybe someone have stolen your private key. 
When you change password, the APP will create a new private key with your username and password and replace 
the old one. And if you lose your private key, you can still recover it from your username and password.

Note: And in this case, if you use a weak password, hacker may stole your account !!!

Actually, EOSVR is a new entrance of Virtual Reality World powered by Block Chain. It is not designed as a wallet. You'd better do not store huge amount of EOS token in it. 



### Private Key and Password

In APP, private key is created by username + password. When you enter the same username + password in another iPhone or Android device, you still can get your account. It is easy to transfer your account between your devices and do not need to remember your private key any more.

Although, it is not so safe as original private key mode. It is much easier and user-friendly to customs. 

For the people who require high safety, they still can use the old private key mode.
